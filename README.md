# 3D Pong

3D Pong is a three-dimesional version of Pong. The rule is the same as Pong. Each player hits a ball with its own paddle and if a player miss to hit and lets the ball reach the wall behind, the other player gets a point. The player who gets 10 points becomes the winner.

The ball moves around the screen and also goes up and down from the surface of the screen to the direction towards the player, I mean you, who plays this game. To make the ball looks like it is moving perpendicular to the screen, the ball becomes gradually bigger when it moves away from the screen and it becomes smaller when it moves towards the screen. The ball color also changes. There is a shade of the ball, which is a hint that you can guess how far the ball is far from the screen.

To make the game exciting and fun, each time the player hits the ball with the paddle, the paddle becomes smaller and it makes it difficult to hit the ball next time. When the player loses the point, the paddle size resets. But the size of the paddle of the other side remains.

## How to play

Player 1(left side) can move the paddle with A(left) W(up) S(down) D(right) key. Player 2(right side) can move the paddle with arrow keys. Hit Return to start and serve the ball.
